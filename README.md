# SIA
repo to provide data and documentation for the SIA challenge @AEC Hackathon 2024

Our Challenge: SIA_GPT. Help us make the contents of the standards available around the clock for specific questions!
The dynamics and requirements in construction projects are increasing rapidly, which is challenging for all participants. The #SIA standards are important guidelines for the design of the built environment. But one must know where to look to find the right information for a specific problem. Given the multitude of sources (data) and resources, the goal is to offer an AI-supported service. This service should integrate sources such as SIA standards and Open Data to answer project-related questions in real-time.

All data may be used freely. The SIA standards may be used from 02.02.-04.02.2024 - after that they must be deleted and may not be forwarded. For use after 04.2024, a request must be made to SIA.  Please confirm your request for access to this data.
